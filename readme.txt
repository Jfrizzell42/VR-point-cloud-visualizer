I am trying to get in contact with dr. Bogert as to how to package my ROS project so that you can view it on systems other than Ubuntu 16.04 included is a simple PC renderer with drag and drop that accepts .txt and xyz files
simply open the project in unreal 4.19.0
hopefully I can find a way to package the ROS portion of my project so that it is testable on other platforms.
